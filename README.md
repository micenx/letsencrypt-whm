# What is this?

This is respository for shell script to automate installation [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificates generated by `certbot-auto`
into WHM-based Linux server.

# Motivation

Latest WHM adds [Let's Encrypt](https://letsencrypt.org/) SSL certificate plugin,
however CPanel dropped support for Centos 6 32-bit system.

This is for WHM user who stuck on WHM version < 58 but want to use
Let's Encrypt SSL certificates automated domain validation tools.

# Requirement

- SSH access to WHM-based server with administrative privilege.
- `certbot-auto` [Installation Guide](https://certbot.eff.org/docs/install.html)
- [PHP](https://php)
- `git`

# Installation

Login to SSH and clone this repository.

# Usage

    # ./letsencrypt.whm.ssl.install.sh [working directory] [domain name]

`[working directory]` is web root directory of `[domain name]` to store
temporary http challenge for domain validation. `[domain name]` is domain name
to generate certificate.

    # ./letsencrypt.whm.ssl.install.sh /home/userxxx/public_html example.com
